# Libft_ASM
The aim of this project is for me to learn more about x64 Assembly and at the side since Libft is used in</br>
the school projects maybe I can have an excuse to use this and get some sort of performance gain from it. So far most functions seem to have some performance gain when compared to C version. Most notably ft_bzero is 10 times faster which is little mind boggling and makes me question if I can improve the C version. If anything, using optimization flags is kinda sometimes forbidden maybe (it's so hazy if it is or not and I'd rather not twist hands about it) so if I just write the assembly like -OX then it's fine right?</br>
As more recent thing, I've been reading through AMD64 Architecture
Programmerâ€™s Manuals and picked up some fancy instructions and now I have a small subset of Libft_ASM original functions that use those instructions.</br>
You will need Make and NASM to compile which you can grab from https://www.nasm.us/ or install through Linux packages. Just run make in terminal and you can link the libft_asm.a to your program. libft_asm.h is the related C header.</br>
Do note that Windows passes arguments to functions in different registers than on Lunix/Mac so none of these actually work on Windows for now. Also interrupts in general are apparently a different world but that an issue for time when I have the first version done in its entirety.

# TODO

1. Create first versions of all basic Libft functions. Proper comments and descriptions included.
2. Windows uses different registers to pass arguments to functions so port them over. It's a bit of work but most of the time it only involves swapping registers around.
3. New functions! This is assembly and there's an entire world of things I can do here that are not implemented in C/C++ so I'm going to take full use of that.
4. Own malloc. First I need to get the C version done but once that exists the ASM version should be easier to do since I have a proper ground to work on. I did some testing on just MMAP and it has massive overhead which I'm definitely not a fan of so I need the entire malloc around it.

# Issues
1. Print functions have issues writing some text. Arrays are too far away as in write doesn't take a long pointer??
